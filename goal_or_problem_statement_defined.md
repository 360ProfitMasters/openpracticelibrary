# Waypoint: "Why" is Defined

The first waypoint in any Journey with Open Innovation Labs is to clearly define "Why" you are taking the Journey in the first place. It's really surprising how often this key detail is forgotten, so we want to make it explicit. Everything that happens on our Journey after this point should tie by to this "Why."

## Acceptance Criteria

- The "Why" for the project is documented and shared
- The "Why" can be easily explained in conversation, without visual aids, in under 60 seconds
- There is consensus that the "Why" can be objectively measured, and ideally but required, these measurements have been defined
- The "Why" has a time box


## Ways to Navigate to This Waypoint:

These are proven techniques to define your "Why", but feel free to take your own approach if it

- Define a SMART Goal. We like the way Gojko Adzic articulates this in Impact Mapping. [A sample](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/impact_mapping_20121001_sample.pdf) can be found on page 5. We often use Impact Mapping as key facilitation technique during the Discovery stage.
- Define a Problem Statement. 18F has a great guide [here](https://lean-product-design.18f.gov/2-problem-statement/), and the way they articulate the problem statement is perfectly acceptable to start an Impact Map
