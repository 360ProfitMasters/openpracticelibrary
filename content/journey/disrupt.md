#Disrupt Journey

This is a style of journey that is closely associated with rapidly co-creating a product. It is used when you wish to create an internal application/service or the next new mobile application that will change the world. Red Hat will accomplish this using the methods and practices of Red Hat Open Innovation Labs alongside you.
