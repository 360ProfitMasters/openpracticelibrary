Welcome to the [Red Hat Open Innovation Labs](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-innovation-labs) Practice Library. Here, we look to provide information on the Practices and Techniques that we call '[Routes](/routes/)' and how they can fit into the overall consulting engagements we describe as '[Journeys](/journeys/)'.

For more information on what a Journey, Stage, Waypoint, or Route is; please visit the [Terms Defined Page](/terms-defined/)
