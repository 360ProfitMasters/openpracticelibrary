Welcome to the [Red Hat Open Innovation Labs](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-innovation-labs) Practice Library. Here, we look to provide information on the [Practices and Techniques](/practices) that are used during our engagements. We also share how we employ those Practices within the overall consulting engagements we describe as '[Journeys](/journeys/)'.

To us, a Journey can be broken down into Stages, Waypoints, Routes, and Practices. To learn more about these concepts, please visit the [Terms Defined Page](/terms-defined/)
