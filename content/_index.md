Welcome to the [Red Hat Open Innovation Labs](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-innovation-labs) Practice Library.

Here, we look to provide information on the [Practices and Techniques](/practices) that are used during our engagements.

If you wish to understand how we employ those Practices within the overall consulting engagements we describe as '[Journeys](/journeys/)', please visit our [Way of Working](/way-of-working/) summary. We also have a list of all of our [concept definitions](/terms-defined/).
