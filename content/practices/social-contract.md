## What is it?

The Social Contract is a simple yet highly effective manner to enable team autonomy and self accountability. It aims to create a working agreement by the team, for the team. This is done by identifying behaviors that they desire to see from their teammates. To effectively use this practice you should look to create the following outcomes:

- Publicly display the working agreement
- Revisit it often and update it as necessary
- Nobody is above the agreement
- The team should holds each other accountable to the behaviors they agree upon


## Why use a Social Contract?

- Quick means to clearly determine inner team dynamics and expectations
- Promote autonomy and self governing of team behavior
- Publicly displaying the contract keeps the team consciously aware of it
