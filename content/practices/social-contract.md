## What is it?

The Social Contract is a simple, yet highly effective manner to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements. It looks to codify the behaviors and expectations of the team. And between the team and its management. This is by identifying behaviors that they desire to see from their teammates and managers. To effectively use this practice you should look to create the following outcomes:

- Public display of the social contract
- Revisit the social contract often and update it as necessary
- Nobody is above the contract
- The team agreed holds each other accountable to the contract

## Why use a Social Contract?

- Quick means to clearly determine team dynamics and expectations
- Promote autonomy and self governing of team behavior
- The contract keeps the team consciously aware of how they work together

## Related Practices

- Working Agreements[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) are a form of social contract often used to help establish behavioral standards between peers on a team. This is a great alternative if you do not have stakeholders or sponsors buying in to a Social Contract.
