title: 'Waypoint: "Why" is Defined'
draft: false

It's really surprising how often organizations fail to communicate "Why" work is important. At Labs, we want to make the "Why" explicit from day 1. Everything that happens on our Journey after this point should tie by to this "Why."

## Proven Ways to Define a Why

These are proven techniques to define your "Why", but feel free to take your own approach if it

- Define a SMART Goal. We like the way Gojko Adzic articulates this in Impact Mapping[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). We often use [Impact Mapping](/technique/impact-mapping/) as key facilitation technique during the Discovery stage.
- Define a Problem Statement[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2). 18F has a great guide, and the way they articulate the problem statement is perfectly acceptable to start an Impact Map
