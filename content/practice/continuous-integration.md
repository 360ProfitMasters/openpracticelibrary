# What is it?

* Merging of changed code into a shared working version of the artifact.
* Triggered upon code commit in a code source repository
* Includes execution of automated tests to assure the change



# Why use it?

* Provides rapid feedback loops to wider team of individual contributions
* Small, regular code commits reduces the amount of integration problems by reducing the risk of conflicting features
