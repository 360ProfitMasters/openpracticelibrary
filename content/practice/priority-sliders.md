## What is it?

* A tool that facilitates conversations about relative priorities and focuses upcoming activities.
* A finite set of topics/dimensions/areas that can be relatively prioritised against each other.
* A slider for each dimension where groups of people collaborative slide the relative importance to the right (more important) or left (less important).



## Why use it?

* Enables an alignment and consensus on areas of focus.
* Provides clarifications across stakeholder groups of motivations and desires.
* Can be used as a filtering mechanism for later prioritisation (of, for example, product backlog items).
