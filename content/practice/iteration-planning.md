## What is it?

* An event where a development team collaborates with the Product Owner to align on the goal and outcome the team are going to focus on for their next iteration of development.
* Team members use this opportunity to further their shared understanding of the Product Owner's (and stakeholders they represent) acceptance criteria (or conditions of satisfaction) for features they are going to accept into the iteration.
* Team members decompose features into low level tasks with full breadth to deliver the features to a level whereby all of the Product Owner's conditions of satisfaction are met and the Definition of Done is satisfied.



## Why use it?

* Provides aligned and shared understanding of features to be worked on.
* Provides a focus session of collaboration between all team members to determine all work tasks required to deliver the features into the next increment on the product.
* A short burst of intense focus to build confidence across the team in their ability to achieve the next outcome and provide a space to collaborate to achieve this.
