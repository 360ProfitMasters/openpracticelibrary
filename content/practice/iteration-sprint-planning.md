## What is it?

It is a planning meeting where the Product Owner together with the team plan and agree which user stories or backlog item will be worked on during the Iteration. This includes defining a overall goal for the  iteration. 

## Why use it?

Iteration or Sprint planning sets up the entire team for success throughout the iteration. Teams tent to focus on goals and activities more, when an end date (deadline) has been set, by which the work needs to be completed. Keeping the overall iteration goal in mind, it keeps the team focused and ensures progress throughout the project.

## How to do it?

Coming into the meeting, the product owner will have a prioritised product backlog. They discuss each item with the development team, and the group collectively estimates the effort involved. The development team will then make a sprint forecast outlining how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. That body of work then becomes the sprint backlog.

This planning meeting will be held at the beginning of a Sprint (Timebox)

INPUTS: Identified set of prioritized and defined User Stories from the Product Owner to the team

AGENDA:

Independently review the Prioritised User Stories (in JIRA)

Each person will have 5 minutes to ask last minute questions

Each person choose an story they will own (can work with other team members)

<break for 30 min for people to independently create tasks to achieve the user story acceptance criteria> 

Each person will have 5 minutes to share the stories they will complete in the next sprint and how they relate to the priorities. 

The group should call out gaps/concerns

OUTPUTS: Closed out previous JIRA Sprint. Load what seems to be an appropriate and agreed upon amount of stories for the next JIRA Sprint. Started next sprint
