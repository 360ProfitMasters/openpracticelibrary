## What is it? 
- A UI workshop is an activity in which particpants quickly sketch rough ideas for the user interface.
- These ideas can be written on a whiteboard, sticky notes, or sheets of paper. (A tall sticky note makes a great template for a mobile screen.)
- The workshop can be run with just a facilitator and a UX designer, but including the entire team is even better.
- At the end of the workshop, the participants can vote by adding dots to their favorites.
- Later on, the best "low-fidelity" designs can be used as the basis for interactive prototypes or more complete designs.

## Why use it? 
- UI design workshops help take a high-level business process (such as an event storm) and turn it into something concrete that developers can begin working on.
- This activity generates new ideas and builds shared understanding - particularly if the entire team gets to participate.
- Jump-start development of the product by creating just enough design for the team to begin working.
- A quick, rewarding activity like this one builds confidence and experience in team members who might be new to user experience design.
- Teams can produce the design assets they need to move forward, even if the team does not have a dedicated UX designer.
