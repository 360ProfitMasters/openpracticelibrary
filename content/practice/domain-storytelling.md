## What is it?

A workshop format that helps to understand how people and/or software systems work together – either currently (analysis of as-is business processes) or in the future (design of to-be business processes). 

A moderator lets domain experts tell typical examples of how they work – so-called Domain Stories. While listening, the moderator records the domain stories using a pictographic language. The domain experts can see immediately if the moderator understands their story correctly. The moderator guides the domain experts by asking questions, for example _who_ – _does what_ – _with what_ – _why_.

A Domain Story covers_ one concrete example._ It shows something that _actually_ happens, rather than all things that could _possibly_ happen. After few stories, the participants are able to talk about the people, activities, tools, work objects, and events in that domain. Often, the conversation that was started with Domain Storytelling is later continued with user stories, example mapping, event storming, ...

## Why use it?

* learn about a new domain and pick up its language
* elicit requirements
* bridge gaps between departments
* find boundaries for (micro)services or bounded contexts (domain-driven design)
* show how new software systems will change current business processes

Domain Storytelling is versatile and adapted for the purpose, for example:

* level of detail: from "big picture" to concrete workflows
* number of participants
* tools: pen&paper, sticky notes, digital modeling tools
