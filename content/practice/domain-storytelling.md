## What is it?

A workshop format that helps to understand how people and/or software systems work together – either currently (analysis of as-is business processes) or in the future (design of to-be business processes). 

A moderator lets domain experts tell typical examples of how they work – so-called Domain Stories. While listening, the moderator records the domain stories using a pictographic language. The domain experts can see immediately if the moderator understands their story correctly. The moderator guides the domain experts by asking questions, for example _who_ – _does what_ – _with what_ – _why_.

After very few stories, the participants are able to talk about the people, tasks, tools, work items, and events in that domain.
