## What is it?

A "Stop the World" event is when somebody on the Team identifies that some of the Acceptance Criteria will not be met or would like to modify a Waypoint(s) based on newer information. The *FULL* Team then works together to find a compromise that is acceptable to them and all involved to still meet the Acceptance Criteria and progress towards the end of the Journey. By the end of the "Stop the World" event, the team should:

- All be in agreement with the proposed compromise
- Identify actions or changes to be made to the [Waypoints](/terms-defined#waypoints)/[Routes](/terms-defined#routes)
- Maintain good Psychological Safety[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) amongst the Team
- Ensure flexibility on facilitation of the techniques by the facilitators
