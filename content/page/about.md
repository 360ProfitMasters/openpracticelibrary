Red Hat Open Innovation Labs is creating an Open Practice Library! The library's source is in [a public GitHub repo](https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library) and is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Who is this Library Intended for
While this is intended for everyone who has an interest in learning more about the Red Hat Open Innovation Labs processes and techniques, we have a few personas that this information architecture is geared towards.

*The Big Picture Person*
This is the person who has heard of Red Hat and Red Hat Open Innovation Labs and is looking for what they use to accomplish engagement success. They want to know why it is used, pointers on how to facilitate it, when it should be employed, and how it fits with other practices. Whether it is to facilitate the session or bring a facilitator in to facilitate, they are seeking more information on delivery of an engagement.

*The Search with Intent Person*
This is the person who is looking to understand more about a particular Practice or Technique that Red Hat Open Innovation Labs uses. They want to know their perspective on a particular Practice. They are either an experienced facilitator looking for new perspective or have heard about one of the Practices and want to know more. They are not looking for more information about how it fits within a larger engagement, just looking to accomplish a certain outcome/output for their project.

## What This Library Is *Not*
An exhaustive, detailed guide to apply these practices. We've tried that, and folks tend to focus on the step by step instruction but miss the "Why" information. Or they just don't read the material, which we understand. Not everyone likes reading thousands of pages of method material like we do.

## What This Library *Is*
Just enough information for each practice to "specify the end state, itâ€™s purpose, and the minimum possible constraints" in order to "create alignment and enable autonomy" for participants and facilitators. Where more detailed content is useful, we'll provide links. This idea comes from Donald Reinersten's *Principle of Mission*, which provides the conceptual foundation to *Lean Enterprise* by Jex Humble, Joanne Molesky & Barry O'Reilly.

## Contributing

We'd love to hear your thoughts about the material presented here or other content you'd like to add. [Open an issue](https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library/issues) and we can go from there.

Alternately, feel free to fork our [github repo](https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library) and submit a PR of your proposed changes. We use markdown files for our base content that gets rendered for this site. For helpful development setup see our [README](https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library/blob/master/README.md)

## How to Fit These Practices into Your Existing Approach
While we have our own approach to engagements, we understand that there might be an approach you are already following. So, we place each practice in the British Design Council's Double Diamond model. This is [originally documented here](http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond), although [we like this slightly broader and more detailed walk through](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812). The Double Diamond model is widely used and easily transferable to other Design Thinking models, so regardless of which approach you use, you should be able to see where each practice fits.
