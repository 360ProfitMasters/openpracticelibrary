## Journeys
  These are the paths that our customers typically take when joining us on a Red Hat Open Innovation Labs engagement. Journeys represent the entirety of the engagement; from the beginning conversations to the sad good-byes. Using a Transportation metaphor, Journeys are the experiences you get, fun you had and what you learned when traveling from a West Coast City to an East Coast City with friends.

## Stages
  Along the Journey, there are many different team members that are required to support obtaining certain outcomes. When you have common sets of people who are involved for a portion of the Journey, we have identified that as a Stage. In Stages, we identify who is involved from both Red Hat and the customer during these sections of the Journey. In our Transportation metaphor, a Stage is the time along the Journey that you are traveling with friends you picked up in one City and need to drop them off in another City along your Journey.

## Waypoints
  Within each Stage, there needs to be a basic structure in order to keep the Journey on track, regardless of the Journey type. This is the idea behind Waypoints. They are the more detailed destination points that have a set of Outcomes and Outputs to be met in order for us to know what we have and the right direction to head to next. They have no time requirement or a strict process on HOW to complete each Waypoint on purpose, as this may vary depending on the Team's expertise. Waypoints are not set in stone and may change, as long as everyone on the team is in agreement. In our Transportation metaphor, Waypoints are the various food, gas and rest stops that you and your friends need to do within a Stage of your Journey.

## Routes
  These are the collections of practices and techniques that are facilitated to achieve the Outcomes and Outputs of the various Waypoints for a Stage. It depends on the Route you take. While there is no **right** Route or **right** way to facilitate a Route, we do identify our Default Routes and a few alternatives our facilitators use. In our Transportation metaphor, Routes are the set of turns that you will take to navigate from a gas station to a rest stop.

## Practices
  These are the practices and techniques that are facilitated to achieve specific outcomes and outputs. Each of the Practices you find here provide insights on some common facilitation techniques. While there is no **right** Route or **right** way to facilitate a Practice, we look to provide how we like to employ the Practice. In our Transportation metaphor, Practices are the more specific roads that you will take to navigate from point A to point B along your [Route](/routes) from a gas station to a rest stop.
