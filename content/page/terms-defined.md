#Journeys
  These are the paths that our customers typically take when joining us on a Red Hat Open Innovation Labs engagement. Journeys represent the entirety of the engagement; from the beginning conversations to the sad good-byes. Using a Transportation metaphor, Journeys are the experiences you get, fun you had and what you learned when traveling from a West Coast City to an East Coast City with friends.

#Stages
  Along the Journey, there are many different team members that are required to support obtaining certain outcomes. When you have common sets of people who are involved for a portion of the Journey, we have identified that as a Stage. In Stages, we identify who is involved from both Red Hat and the customer during these sections of the Journey. In our Transportation metaphor, a Stage is the time along the Journey that you are traveling with friends that you picked up at one City and need to drop them off at another City along your Journey.

#Waypoints
  Within each Stage, there needs to be a basic structure in order to keep the Journey on track, despite the variations between Journey types. This is the idea behind Waypoints. They are the turns and directional points that have a set of Acceptance Criteria (A/C) that should be met before we know the right direction to head. They are not set in stone and may change as long as everyone on the team is in agreement ("Stop the World" concept[<sup>1</sup>](<need to add a link to this once created>). There is no time requirement or strict process on HOW to achieve it, but a set of desired Outcomes and a few Outputs. In our Transportation metaphor, Waypoints are the various food, gas and rest stops that you and your friends need to do along your Journey.

#Routes
  These are the practices and techniques that are facilitated to achieve the Acceptance Criteria (A/C) of the various Waypoints. Routes may satisfy multiple Waypoints or you may need multiple routes to reach the Waypoint. It depends on the Route you take. We are purposeful in not identifying *how* each Route is facilitated, but more on why you would use it and what the outcomes and outputs are, which in turn support reaching a Waypoint. Each of the Routes you find here do provide insights on some common facilitation techniques. While there is no **right** Route or **right** way to facilitate a Route, we do identify our Default Routes and our facilitator technique favorites. In our Transportation metaphor, Routes are the more specific roads that you will take to navigate from the gas station to the hotel as you travel from City to City.
