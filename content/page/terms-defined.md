## Practices
  These are the practices and techniques that are facilitated to achieve specific outcomes and outputs. While there is no **right** Route or **right** way to facilitate a practice, we look to share how we like to employ the practice. In our Transportation metaphor, practices are the more specific roads that you will take to navigate from point A to point B along your Route from a gas station to a rest stop. Sometimes it is 1 road, sometimes it is multiple roads you must take to reach your next location.
