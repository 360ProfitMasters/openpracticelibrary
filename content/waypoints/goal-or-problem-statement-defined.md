## Intent of Waypoint
Want to be sure there is a clear and easily understood statement regarding why the future work is needed, before beginning the work. Residencies need a purpose that is easily understood to help drive the most innovative and quick solutions.

## Outcomes

- The Goal/Problem Statement is:
  - Business Value[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) focused
  - Documented and Shared openly
  - Measurable (ideally with repeatable metrics)
  - Easily explained in conversation without visual aids
- Consensus that the Goal/Problem Statement is the correct one to work on
