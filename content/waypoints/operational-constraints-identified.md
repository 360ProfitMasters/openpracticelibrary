# Intent of Waypoint
Want to understand what constraints that a customer has when it comes to the engagement. Constraints are things like:

- Technology products that you can/can't use
- Specific architectures
- Target environments during and after engagement
- Specific teams or skillsets

## Outcomes

- Documented constraints that affect the engagement
- Documented decisions about the engagement
