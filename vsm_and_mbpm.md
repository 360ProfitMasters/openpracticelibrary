# Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM)

## What is it?

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM) are third generation lean process improvement techniques. They work in tandem, where VSM is designed to view the big, macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives, and MBPM is designed to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers. The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyota's "information and material flow" (as documented in [Lean Thinking](https://www.lean.org/BookStore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductID=88) and the second generation from [Learning to See](https://www.lean.org/Bookstore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductId=9).

## Why use VSM & MBPM?

In the context of software delivery, VSM & MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize "brownfield" delivery processes, including everything from requirements definition, infrastructure provisioning and application development.

Being derived from Lean Manufacturing, VSM & MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization, at both a macro and micro level, from the time a customer requests a good/service, until the time a customer receives the good/service. When used together, these tools are particularly effective at:

- building shared understand throughout the various levels of an organization how work is actually done
- creating the urgency for improvement
- formulating specific, data driven improvement plans
- preventing "improvement" work in a particular area that leads to sub-optimization for the entire value stream / process
