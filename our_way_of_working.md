# Our Way of Working

## What
- Every residency is a journey
  - an expedition in search of transformation, disruption, or knowledge (explore/road trip).
  - composed of a series of stages - the people involved, as well as our mode of operation, will be different at each stage
  - Ships example graphics
	  - Beginning - Charting a course
    - Middle - Packing up the ship
    - End - Sailing
- To ensure we don't get lost along the journey, we establish a series of way point on the way to our destination
  - Way points:
	  - create a shared understanding of where we are going
	  - remind us of where we've been
	  - provide a simple framework to guide decision making when situations arise that require a course correction
- As an accelerant, we've researched and tested various techniques to navigate between each way point
  - graphic showing various paths
- But everyone's journey is unique, and we're discovery new ways of working everyday. so we encourage teams to constantly **(E9)** review their way points, as well as the ways they navigate between them, and course correct as deemed prudent
- But change can be scary, so - we've created a simple decision making framework to help the teams make effective and efficient decisions when changing course
  - When navigating from way point A to B:
    - teams, and even individuals, are empowered to independently/autonomously change course so long as the resulting path still navigates the team from way point A to way point B
    - if the course correction would require the journey to navigate to a different way point (which may yet to be defined), then the team needs to huddle up and make that decision collectively

## Why
- Before we get into an example, we need to make sure you understand WHY we've put this framework in place. Bolded items are Principles put into place from Donald Reinerstens' Second Generation Lean Product Development Flow:
  - Way points ensure:
	  - **(E13)** all team members algin on decision making, even if making decisions independently
	  - **(E13)** decision making is streamlined in order to maximize the value derived from each decisions
	  - **(E8)(E10)(D1)** small decisions are common and frequent so we decentralize them in order to make as many as possible
	  - **(D2)** larger decisions, like changing the way points are infrequent and highly impactful, so we centralize them as the cost of error is much higher
	  - **(E14)** the team owns decision making (it's not top down), so they feel cost and benefit of their decisions, which informs better decision making along the journey
- ultimately the goal of this approach (our Why), is to build psychological safety throughout the journey.
  - teams that establish psychological safety are statistically proven to the outperform teams that do not.
  - the way points that we use as the default for a Labs journey create a "psychological safety net".
  - our decision making framework helps to ensure that when we course correct (because we will, it's a fact of life), our decisions reinforce the psychological safety net of the journey, instead od weakening it.
