# A Placeholder Practice Library

The Open Innovation Labs team is creating a practice library. This is a placeholder until we can make something prettier.

## What This Repository Is *Not*
An exhaustive, detailed guide to apply these practices. We've tried that, and folks tend to focus on the step by step instruction but miss the "Why" information. Or they just don't read the material, which we understand. Not everyone likes reading thousands of pages of method material like we do.

## What This Repository *Is*
Just enough information for each practice to "specify the end state, itâ€™s purpose, and the minimum possible constraints" in order to "create alignment and enable autonomy" for participants and facilitators. Where more detailed content is useful, we'll provide links. This idea comes from Donald Reinersten's *Principle of Mission*, which provides the conceptual foundation to *Lean Enterprise* by Jex Humble, Joanne Molesky & Barry O'Reilly.

## How to Fit These Practices into Your Existing Approach
We place each practice in the British Design Council's Double Diamond model, which is [originally documented here](http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond), although [we like this slightly broader and more detailed walk through](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812). The Double Diamond model is widely used and easily transferable to other Design Thinking models, so regardless of which approach you use, you should be able to see where each practice fits.
