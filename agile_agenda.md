# Agile Agenda

## What is it?

The Agile Agenda is a simple, yet effective way to manage the agenda for an in person workshop using sticky notes and a whiteboard. The basic idea is draw a days calendar on to the whiteboard, split it into 2 or more tracks, write agenda items on sticky notes (with owners!) and then place them on the whiteboard in the correct time slot. Should look something like this:

## Why use Agile Agenda?

- It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modelling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period
- The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:
  - slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.
  - pick and choose participants by session
  - provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)
- It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process
- It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process
- It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design

## Materials Needed

- Butcher paper roll or drawing paper roll [like this one from Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise
- 2 different colors of wide format sticky notes [like these](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Notes-Cape-Collection-655-5PK/dp/B00006JNNG)
- 4 different colors of small square sticky notes [like these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1UE0JY?psc=1)
- Markers


## Process Phase
Event Storming is a great way to kick off the "Develop Potential Solutions" phase of the Double Diamond model.
