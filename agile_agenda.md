# Agile Agenda

## What is it?

The Agile Agenda is a simple, yet effective way to manage the agenda for an in person workshop using sticky notes and a whiteboard. The basic idea is draw a days calendar on to the whiteboard, split it into 2 or more tracks, write agenda items on sticky notes (with owners!) and then place them on the whiteboard in the correct time slot. Review your agenda in the morning, and then come back to it throughout the day, updating as need be. It should look something like this:

## Why use an Agile Agenda?

- Sessions like [event storming](event_storming.md) or [user story mapping](user_story_mapping.md) don't neatly fit into time boxes. As such, you'll need to dynamic with the way you manage the agenda.
- Whiteboards and stickies are easier to change than digital agendas which might need some formatting or even have access issues.
- It works as an [information radiator](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator) throughout the workshop, making it a logical area to gather the team to review the agenda as well as do time checks. Compare this to an agenda captured in a slide deck, which doesn't naturely lead to a team huddle.

- [Collaborative Face Drawing](http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/) is a great ice breaker or after lunch activity. Your agile agenda can be a nice home for the faces once the activity is over as seen below:
