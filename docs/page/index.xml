      <description>#Journeys These are the paths that our customers typically take when joining us on a Red Hat Open Innovation Labs engagement. Journeys represent the entirety of the engagement; from the beginning conversations to the sad good-byes. Using a Transportation metaphor, Journeys are the experiences you get, fun you had and what you learned when traveling from a West Coast City to an East Coast City with friends.
#Stages Along the Journey, there are many different team members that are required to support obtaining certain outcomes.</description>

      <description>Red Hat Open Innovation Labs is creating a practice library! The library&amp;rsquo;s source is in a public GitHub repo and is licensed under Apache 2.0.
What This Library Is Not An exhaustive, detailed guide to apply these practices. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried that, and folks tend to focus on the step by step instruction but miss the &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; information. Or they just don&amp;rsquo;t read the material, which we understand. Not everyone likes reading thousands of pages of method material like we do.</description>
