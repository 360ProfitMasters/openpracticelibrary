      <description>This is the Way all of the concepts and terms come together and form our Way of Working. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to read through all of this? visit this video .
Our framework is built around a transportation metaphor, the idea that you want to be immersed in Red Hatâ€™s culture and technology to take you from one place to another.
And thus we refer to every customer engagement as a Journey.</description>

      <description>Journeys These are the paths that our customers typically take when joining us on a Red Hat Open Innovation Labs engagement. Journeys represent the entirety of the engagement; from the beginning conversations to the sad good-byes. Using a Transportation metaphor, Journeys are the experiences you get, fun you had and what you learned when traveling from a West Coast City to an East Coast City with friends.
See all Journeys.</description>
