# Event Storming

## What is it?

Event Storming is a rapid, interactive approach to business process discovery and design that yields high quality models. It was introduced by [Alberto Brandolini in 2013](http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html). At the end of the event storm, you should have:

- A shared understand of the business process you are building as part of the project, including:
  - which steps should be considered in scope and which steps are out of scope
  - the users involved in the process
  - an initial inventory of UI screens for the process
  - an initial inventory of [aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html)
- A physical diagram with the above information, which can be transferred to a digital format


## Why use Event Storming?

- It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modelling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period
- The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:
  - slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.
  - pick and choose participants by session
  - provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)
- It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process
- It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process
- It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design


## Related Practices

- [User Story Mapping](user_story_mapping.md) is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with Event Storming
- [Journey Mapping](http://www.designkit.org/methods/63) can provide a high level overview of the business process before using Event Storming to get into the details
- Event Storming will identify key views for your user interface, which can jump start [Site Mapping](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/site-mapping/) or [Wireframing](https://methods.18f.gov/make/wireframing/)


## Who do you need?

- Facilitator
- Product Owner
- User Experience Design
- Analysts
- Developers
- Testers (optional but recommended)


## Suggested Time

- ~6 Hours not including breaks
- Facilitate in small sessions @ around ~90 minutes each
- Session can be done on different days


## Difficultly
- Facilitator: Moderate
- Participants: Easy


## Materials Needed

- Butcher paper roll or drawing paper roll [like this one from Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise
- 2 different colors of wide format sticky notes [like these](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Notes-Cape-Collection-655-5PK/dp/B00006JNNG)
- 4 different colors of small square sticky notes [like these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1UE0JY?psc=1)
- Markers


## Process Phase
Event Storming is a great way to kick off the "Develop Potential Solutions" phase of the Double Diamond model.
