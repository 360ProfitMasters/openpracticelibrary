# Event Storming

## What is it?

Event Storming is a rapid, interactive approach to business process discovery and design that yields high quality models.

## Why use Event Storming?
- It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modelling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period
- The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:
  - slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.
  - pick and choose participants by session
  - provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)
- It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process
- It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process
- It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design
